# Technical Test - Solid Software

This project is a React Native application developed with Expo. It displays a "Hello there" message on the screen, and when the user clicks anywhere on the screen, the background color is randomized. The transition between colors is smoothed using an animation with the `react-native-reanimated` library. Additionally, the project was developed following clean architecture principles and includes unit tests with Jest.

## Features

- Displays a "Hello there" message on the screen.
- Randomizes the background color when clicking anywhere on the screen.
- Smooth color transitions using `react-native-reanimated`.
- Unit tests with Jest.
- Clean architecture for better code organization and maintainability.
